# bibliography
A bibliography in BibTeX format.

This is my bibliography in BibTeX format. I am not an academic, so most of the stuff in here is books.

I have been editing the file using ebib in Emacs, and working at getting the keywords stuff working to make the taxonomy easier.

At some point I will add a file regarding the taxanomic breakdown of the content.

It is worth noting that I prefer to actually read than to manage my library, so I don't spend lots of time on this.

Stuff I want to fix or improve:

1) Proper taxanomic information for the books, something along the lines of:

Physical form: hardback, paperback, mobi, pdf or cbz

where:
mobi - kindle format
pdf - portable document format 
cbz - graphic novel

Genre: sci-fi, horror, romance, etc

Status: read/to-read

Notes

2) Collection information (for stuff on my kindle).
