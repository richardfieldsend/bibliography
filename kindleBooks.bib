                  The end of the earth and Arthur being rescued by
                  Ford Prefect etc. In Adams it is endearing, in Dan
                  Brown it was bloody irritating! In 'Life...' Adams
                  rescues Arthur and Ford using a Chesterfield sofa
                  and eddies in the space-time continuum, and suddenly
                  you're back running with the brilliant insanity that
                  is the HHGTTG canon.  In terms of writing, Adams has
                  clearly got even better by this point, and the ideas
                  are brilliant too. Killer cricket playing robots for

                  while never falling into a Richard Curtis type

                  willingly follow.  This means he can really have fun
                  with the written form.  The best example is
                  measuring the pacing of the first intimacy between
                  Arthur and Fenchurch using Dire Straits songs and
                  writing a whole chapter just so he can end it with a

                  processes.  There is also a lot of information about
                  Douglas Adams' working style.  He was once quoted as
                  saying that he loved deadlines.  He loved the
                  whooshing sounds they made as they flew past your
                  head.  Both radio series are covered, including the
                  very different take which the radio series has on
                  the events after Arthur, Ford, Zaphod and Trillian
                  leave the restaurant at the end of the universe.  It
                  is clear that while Adams was innovative and
                  brilliant he was probably hugely infuriating to work
                  with, especially in terms of the pressures that he
                  must have put everyone else under by his inability

                  Douglas clearly didn't want to rest on his laurels

                  science fiction.  This book was the first result of his
                  efforts.  Dirk Gently appears to be a classic
                  gumshoe in the Film Noir tradition, but he differs
                  in his approach as he searches not just for a
                  solution, but for a complete, holistic one.  There
                  are many ideas which could have found their way into
                  the Hitch Hikers series, especially the 'electric
                  monk' that people used to believe in things for
                  them, but there are some which, because of their
                  earth bound nature are very specifically Dirk
                  Gently.  One example is the section about the one
                  way system in Cambridge.  It is described as being
                  so complex that it can only be conquered by going
                  around and around at growing speed until reaching a
                  form of escape velocity, at which point the driver
                  would fly off into the rural wilds around the city
                  where they could consult a map, determine their
                  whereabouts and plot a route home carefully avoiding

                  for a Sunday paper back in the 1980s. Douglas Adams
                  and Mark Carwardine worked on a piece about the
                  search for an animal which was on the verge of
                  extinction.  Discussing the challenges when they
                  were working together they decided it would be a
                  nice idea to do a whole book of these adventures.
                  This is the result.  In some ways the whole idea is
                  depressing, these are animals, after all who are
                  probably extinct now (the book is approaching its
                  20th anniversary), but Douglas Adams' writing
                  manages to tread the fine line between humour and
                  tragedy. The audiobook is also worth a listen as its
                  read by the late, much missed Douglas Adams himself.
                  The BBC recently revisited the concept with old
                  friend of Adams', Stephen Fry.  I can think of
                  no-one else who could have done it justice. }

                  Elizabeth meets stand-offish Fitzwilliam Darcy. They
                  quickly take against each other, but slowly,
                  balletically, all is fixed, and by the end of the

                  excellent idea for a story, but he doesn't really

                  Presentation provides an extremely approachable
                  guide to some of the latest thinking on cascading
                  style sheets for separating out content from
                  presentation. Filled with useful advice on coping
                  with the real difficulties of using CSS in the real
                  world, this book fills a valuable niche with its
                  compact format and savvy advice from the field.The
                  practical perspective on today's CSS and XHTML
                  standards, as well as an excellent eye for Web
                  design, helps to distinguish this text. After a tour
                  of the evolution of today's Web standards, from HTML
                  to XHTML to CSS used to format underlying content,
                  the authors provide plenty of actual pages using
                  style sheets. They work slowly to build a basic set
                  of terms and techniques with style sheets. There's
                  good coverage of all the options here, like inline
                  and external CSS and most everything in between.We
                  liked the book's coverage of font and type from a
                  design perspective, before digging in to using CSS
                  to format text. (This approach helps show what you
                  should aim for when you present Web pages built with
                  CSS.) Extensive samples of a variety of Web page
                  styles using multicolumn formats will get you
                  started on your own Web pages, regardless of your
                  site's requirements.The book closes with several
                  standout sections on coping with the admitted
                  difficulties of getting CSS to work correctly on all
                  of today's major browsers (including Netscape and
                  Internet Explorer). The authors provide specific
                  suggestions for overcoming known incompatibilities,
                  as well as suggesting general techniques for
                  troubleshooting and testing your site across
                  different browsers. Final samples show off CSS and
                  XHTML used for three case studies: a photo gallery,
                  a personal log, and an online store.With its
                  practical suggestions for using CSS in real projects
                  and a generally approachable style, this book offers
                  a truly winning combination. It's perfect for anyone
                  who wants to get a better knowledge of CSS used to
                  build Web pages that will look good across a range
                  of today's browsers. --Richard Dragan},

                  advice for facing a million and one small challenges
                  in this gem that was a runaway bestseller in
                  Britain. Readers of the UK's Guardian magazine
                  already know and love Guy Browning as the author of
                  a droll weekly column. In Never Hit a Jellyfish with
                  a Spade, Browning introduces his laugh-out-loud
                  rules for living to an American audience. He
                  interprets life's smaller truths and tackles
                  everyday matters with a keen eye and a distinctive,
                  sardonic wit. His tongue-in-cheek advice spans a
                  wide range of topics Sickness and Health, Cooking
                  and Eating, Fashion and Grooming, Sleeping and
                  Waking, Love and Marriage, and more, encompassing: -
                  How to evaluate a bottle of wine (if the alcohol
                  content is less than 15 percent, send it straight
                  back) - How to get what you want at the barber's (no
                  multipart instructions, please) - How to pretend to
                  laugh at a friend's joke (the closest most men get
                  to faking orgasm) In Never Hit a Jellyfish with a

                  shattering look at widespread ecological degradation
                  and touched off an environmental awareness that
                  still exists. Rachel Carson's book focused on the
                  poisons from insecticides, weed killers, and other
                  common products as well as the use of sprays in
                  agriculture, a practice that led to dangerous
                  chemicals to the food source. Carson argued that
                  those chemicals were more dangerous than radiation
                  and that for the first time in history, humans were
                  exposed to chemicals that stayed in their systems
                  from birth to death. Presented with thorough
                  documentation, the book opened more than a few eyes
                  about the dangers of the modern world and stands

                  Einstein's equation that explores the principles of
                  physics through everyday life. Professor Brian Cox
                  and Professor Jeff Forshaw go on a journey to the
                  frontier of 21st century science to consider the
                  real meaning behind the iconic sequence of symbols
                  that make up Einstein's most famous
                  equation. Breaking down the symbols themselves, they
                  pose a series of questions: What is energy? What is
                  mass? What has the speed of light got to do with
                  energy and mass? In answering these questions, they
                  take us to the site of one of the largest scientific
                  experiments ever conducted. Lying beneath the city
                  of Geneva, straddling the Franco-Swiss boarder, is a
                  27 km particle accelerator, known as the Large
                  Hadron Collider. Using this gigantic machine - which
                  can recreate conditions in the early Universe
                  fractions of a second after the Big Bang - Cox and
                  Forshaw will describe the current theory behind the
                  origin of mass. Alongside questions of energy and
                  mass, they will consider the third, and perhaps,
                  most intriguing element of the equation: 'c' - or
                  the speed of light. Why is it that the speed of
                  light is the exchange rate? Answering this question
                  is at the heart of the investigation as the authors
                  demonstrate how, in order to truly understand why
                  E=mc2, we first must understand why we must move

                  manly pursuits. So far the only one I've actually
                  had a go at was making pickled eggs (though I didn't
                  use the recipe in the book). If you like pickled
                  eggs then have a go, they're simple to do and you

                  riddle of time, which examines the consequences of

                  suggestions about what recent research may
                  reveal.The eternal questions of science and religion
                  were profoundly recast by Einstein's theory of
                  relativity and its implications that time can be
                  warped by motion and gravitation, and that it cannot
                  be meaningfully divided into past, present, and
                  future.In About Time, Paul Davies discusses the big
                  bang theory, chaos theory, and the recent discovery
                  that the universe appears to be younger than some of
                  the objects in it, concluding that Einstein's theory
                  provides only an incomplete understanding of the
                  nature of time. Davies explores unanswered questions
                  such as:* Does the universe have a beginning and an
                  end?* Is the passage of time merely an illusion?* Is

                  cliches, but there are some usages - smug statements
                  of secondhand opinion, grating nuggets of folk
                  wisdom, toe-curling verbal flourishes of the
                  would-be authoritative - that go beyond the bounds
                  of cliche to enter more desperate linguistic
                  territory. We encounter these verbal horrors every
                  day of our lives - in conversations overheard on
                  tube, train and bus and at suburban dinner parties,
                  in the fictional dialogues of TV drama - and even in
                  the glib formulations of TV sports
                  commentators. They are disparate in nature - but
                  have one thing in common: they all represent
                  desperate attempts on the part of the speaker to
                  persuade the listener that certainty of language
                  mirrors certainty of thought and intellect, to
                  project a verbal front of decidedness, authority and
                  knowledge. Willie Donaldson has turned his finely
                  tuned satirical ear to these verbal inanities to
                  create a unique, offbeat and entirely hilarious
                  dictionary of cringemaking Islingtonian
                  phrasemaking.But the twist is this: lurking behind
                  the A-Z facade is a dramatis personae of gabbling
                  middle-class archetypes, including the Simon of the
                  title - a Canonbury-based wine importer - and his
                  overwrought partner, Susan, a university
                  academic. Their excruciating dialogues -
                  conversational nightmares of pat phrases, glib
                  opinion and conjugal bitchiness played out in the
                  fictional context of a Barnsbury tapas bar named the
                  Goya - are brilliantly captured by the author, and

                  shows hackers of all ability levels how to take on a
                  wide range of projects, from the relatively small
                  but energy-conscious automating of light switches,
                  to building home theaters using Windows or
                  Linux-based PCs, to more complicated projects like
                  building home security systems that rival those
                  offered by professional security consultants. Each
                  project includes a conceptual diagram, a "What You
                  Need List" and a small "Project Stats" section that
                  describes the relative difficulty, time involved,
                  and cost of the project. What's more, each project
                  is a workable, practical way to improve your
                  home--something unique that you can customize for
                  your individual needs. The thirteen projects in Home
                  Hacking Projects for Geeks are divided into three
                  categories: Home Automation, Home Entertainment
                  Systems, and Security, and include projects such
                  as:Remotely Monitor Your PetMake Your House

	abstract = {Niall Fergusson's most important book to date-a
                  revolutionary reinterpretation of the modern era
                  that resolves its central paradox: why unprecedented
                  progress coincided with unprecedented violence and
                  why the seeming triumph of the West bore the seeds
                  of its undoing. From the conflicts that presaged the
                  First World War to the aftershocks of the cold war,
                  the twentieth century was by far the bloodiest in
                  all of human history. How can we explain the
                  astonishing scale and intensity of its violence
                  when, thanks to the advances of science and
                  economics, most people were better off than ever
                  before-eating better, growing taller, and living
                  longer?  Wherever one looked, the world in 1900
                  offered the happy prospect of ever-greater
                  interconnection. Why, then, did global progress
                  descend into internecine war and genocide?  Drawing
                  on a pioneering combination of history, economics,
                  and evolutionary theory, Niall Ferguson-one of Time
                  magazine's "100 Most Influential People"-masterfully
                  examines what he calls the age of hatred and sets
                  out to explain what went wrong with modernity. On a
                  quest that takes him from the Siberian steppe to the
                  plains of Poland, from the streets of Sarajevo to
                  the beaches of Okinawa, Ferguson reveals an age
                  turned upside down by economic volatility,
                  multicultural communities torn apart by the
                  irregularities of boom and bust, an era poisoned by
                  the idea of irreconcilable racial differences, and a
                  struggle between decaying old empires and predatory
                  new states. Who won the war of the world? We tend to
                  assume it was the West. Some even talk of the
                  American century. But for Ferguson, the biggest
                  upshot of twentieth-century upheaval was the decline
                  of Western dominance over Asia. A work of revelatory
                  interpretive power, The War of the World is Niall
                  Ferguson's masterwork.},

	key = {paperback},
	abstract = {Helen Fielding's novel Bridget Jones's Diary had a
                  meandering, rather shapeless shape (as diaries
                  will). Both fans and critics of that 1998 smash hit
                  will be surprised to find that the author's first
                  novel, previously unpublished in the United States,
                  is a lot more sophisticated in structure. And Cause
                  Celeb is nearly as fun as Bridget Jones's Diary,
                  which is saying a lot, especially since Fielding's
                  debut is about African famine. The narrator, Rosie
                  Richardson, runs a relief camp in the invented
                  country of Nambula. Henry, the most flippant member
                  of her staff, wears a T-shirt that tersely lists the
                  various motivations for relief workers to come to
                  Africa: "(a) Missionary? (b) Mercenary? (c) Misfit?
                  (d) Broken heart?" As Rosie herself admits, she is
                  "a c/d hybrid and soft in the head to boot."
                  Flashbacks reveal that in London, Rosie had fallen
                  in love with an erratic, emotionally abusive (but
                  adorable!) newscaster. As she trailed about town in
                  Oliver's wake, she came to know his in-crowd of
                  movie stars, directors, and musicians. Her split
                  with this media magnet is what initially sent her to
                  Africa. Four years into Rosie's exile, however, a
                  plague of locusts descends on the crops of a
                  neighboring country, and refugees begin to flood her
                  camp. She decides there's only one thing to do: go
                  back home and round up her old celeb pals for a
                  benefit TV special. It should come as no shock that
                  the London sequences are great fun, as is the
                  climactic collision between movie stars and
                  refugees. But the real treat is Fielding's handling
                  of the camp sequences. Rosie and her staff struggle
                  with their petty emotions as they confront the
                  incredible suffering in front of them. Henry watches
                  in disbelief as some starving refugees move their
                  tent to a better location: "Never mind the old
                  malnutrition--you go for the view." A newswoman
                  visits the camp, and, fraught with emotion after
                  first seeing the starving children, she caresses
                  Rosie, whose response is this: "I hope the famine
                  hadn't turned her into a lesbian." Fielding has
                  found a voice that is both compassionate and
                  irreverent, a rare and wonderful
                  combination. --Claire Dederer},

                  scores of other conservatives whom, he says, are

                  are often entertaining and insightful. Franken

                  and performer who is also a Harvard fellow as well
                  as a liberal political commentator. This unique and
                  vaguely lonely position lends a charming quixotic
                  quality to adventures such as a tense encounter with

                  the charade). Less useful are comic book
                  dramatizations of "Supply Side Jesus" and a
                  fictitious Vietnam War story featuring the numerous
                  righties who, Franken intimates, improperly avoided
                  service. And Franken's criticisms of conservative
                  talk show hosts Sean Hannity, O'Reilly, and
                  columnist Coulter, while admirable in their
                  attention to detail, fail to shed much new light on
                  people who have built careers on broad arguments and
                  relentless self-aggrandizement. But Franken is at
                  his best, and most compellingly readable, when he
                  backs off the wackiness and the personal grudges and
                  writes about more personal matters such as the
                  political circus surrounding the memorial service of
                  the late Senator Paul Wellstone. But even on these
                  more serious topics, Franken's wit is still present
                  and, in fact, grows sharper. In a time when much
                  political discourse is composed of rage and
                  shouting, it's refreshing that Al Franken is able to
                  shout in a witty manner. --John Moe},

                  with memorable firsts-first smiles . . . first words

                  natural that an artist best known for her
                  celebration of babies would create the perfect place
                  to save these precious moments for posterity. My
                  First Five Years-Flower Edition is graced throughout
                  with the remarkable images of acclaimed photographer
                  Anne Geddes. She uses the gorgeous imagery from
                  Miracle, her heartfelt collaboration with singer
                  Celine Dion, to cast a magical feeling over the
                  entire journal. Each turn of the page reveals an
                  enchanting image and yet another example of her deep
                  and abiding love for babies-a slumbering baby rests
                  gently atop a peony, the calla lily petals offer
                  protection to a newborn in its loving caress, an
                  orchid tenderly cradles a sleeping child. Through
                  Geddes' eyes we are able to experience the innocence
                  and preciousness of new life. My First Five Years is
                  filled with touches that make this a truly special
                  journal-an envelope to hold a baby's first lock of
                  hair, height and weight charts to track growth
                  through the years, and plenty of room for
                  announcements and your own child's photos and
                  mementos. My First Five Years-Flower Edition will
                  become a treasured keepsake of a time that passes

                  very successful career as an internist to raise her
                  children and devote more time to writing. After
                  several books that have had moderate success,
                  Gerritsen has now written a gruesome and frightening
                  story that should put her among the top women
                  thriller writers working today. A serial killer is
                  on the loose in Boston. The victims are killed in a
                  particularly nasty way: cut with a scalpel on the
                  stomach, the intestines and uterus removed, and then
                  the throat slashed. The killer obviously has medical
                  knowledge and has been dubbed "the Surgeon" by the
                  media. Detective Thomas Moore and his partner
                  Rizzoli of the Boston Homicide Unit have discovered
                  something that makes this case even more
                  chilling. Years ago in Savannah a serial killer
                  murdered in exactly the same way. He was finally
                  stopped by his last victim, who shot him as he tried
                  to cut her. That last victim is Dr. Catherine
                  Cordell, who now works as a cardiac surgeon at one
                  of Boston's prestigious hospitals. As the murders
                  continue, it becomes obvious that the killer is
                  drawing closer and closer to Dr. Cordell, who is
                  becoming so frightened that she is virtually unable
                  to function. But she is the only person who can help
                  the police catch this copycat killer. Or is it a
                  copycat? To complicate matters even further,
                  Detective Moore, often referred to as Saint Thomas
                  as he continues to mourn the loss of his wife, is
                  getting emotionally involved with the doctor. The
                  suspense in The Surgeon is almost unbearable. The
                  writing is superb and the stunning twists and turns
                  make it almost impossible to put down. -- Otto

                  specialises in working with criminals, Godsi is
                  uniquely placed to give an insight to the mad, bad
                  and dangerous to know. His central thesis is that
                  the manner in which people act is a reflection on
                  how they have been treated, and this fact needs to
                  be acknowledged to move forward.  Unfortunately this
                  then leads on to considerations that, as a whole,
                  society is becoming more chaotic and violent, and
                  that this in turn is likely to increase the
                  incidence of random and awful attacks, like the one
                  on Jame Bulger. A fascinating, but sometimes

                  fundamentals of the language, such as basic language
                  constructs, variable types, functions, program
                  logic, looping, and simple console I/O. The second
                  half presents more ANSI C functions, arrays, and
                  strings. Only then does the author take on the
                  difficulties of C pointers. The tutorial closes with
                  some file I/O and the basics of using multi-file
                  projects. Throughout these two books, the author
                  succeeds in making programming fun with a lot of
                  humor (including comics) and as little jargon as
                  possible. The technical information is in there too,
                  between the lines, in separate sections. Each
                  chapter ends with a quiz to make sure you are
                  getting all the basics of programming in C (answers
                  are included at the end of volume two). Plenty of
                  source code is provided for all examples. All in
                  all, this set provides a really successful
                  introduction to C programming, which can succeed
                  where other tutorials fail. If you've been stumped
                  by other introduction to C texts, check out these
                  two books.},

                  general public to the world of quantum physics in
                  1984 with his book In Search of Schr\"odinger's
                  Cat. A dizzying, counterintuitive domain, the
                  quantum world is so strange that Richard Feynman,
                  the greatest physicist of his time, admitted,
                  "nobody understands quantum physics." Science has
                  not stood still in the years since In Search of
                  Schr\"odinger's Cat was written, and in this new
                  book, Gribbin brings us up to speed on the latest
                  developments. New interpretive models have been put
                  forth about the nature of particles and light;
                  experimental evidence has turned over many of the
                  basic precepts of the Copenhagen interpretation,
                  which says that until it is observed, the subatomic
                  world exists only as a probability wave, lacking any
                  objective reality independent of observation. The
                  new models offer not only a paradigm independent of
                  an observer, but also begin to unite quantum
                  phenomena with relativity and Newtonian
                  mechanics. This is not to say that the quantum realm
                  has become more comprehensible. With particles
                  existing simultaneously as particles and waves,
                  feedback loops, and waves that move forward and
                  backward in time, the quantum world is still a
                  strange, strange place; it's just a little less
                  solipsistic. As in his previous books, Gribbin
                  deftly translates the abstruse mathematics of these
                  new theories into a highly readable narrative that
                  informs as it entertains. Schr\"odinger's Kittens
                  and the Search for Reality is a book that can be
                  enjoyed by expert and layman alike.},

                  supplement this book with another if you don't know
                  what you're doing. Hekman devotes about a third of
                  the book to Linux user commands that aren't part of
                  specific shells, programming languages,
                  applications, or the set of administrator
                  commands. These commands are presented as straight
                  man-page-style documentation in table form, listing
                  commands, their switches, and succinct descriptions

                  the three Linux shells--bash, csh, and tcsh--and the
                  GNU utilities. The book's coverage of emacs, vi,
                  pattern matching (regular expressions), sed, and
                  gawk distinguishes it from its competitors. Hekman

                  threw its shadows, and the shadows sometimes
                  separated us."Since Manderly burned, tormented Maxim
                  de Winter and his demure second wife have fled the
                  ghosts of a dark, unspoken yesterday. And now they
                  have come home to England -- to bury what was and to
                  start anew. But the sensual warmth of a golden
                  autumn cannot mask the chill of a lingering
                  evil. For October's gentle breeze whispers that
                  Rebecca -- beautiful, mysterious, malevolent Rebecca
                  -- is haunting their lives once more.},

	abstract = {Beginning Java 2 is one of the two best introductory
                  Java 2 books available. (The other is Peter van der
                  Linden's Just Java 1.2.) Assuming nothing more than
                  curiosity and tenacity, this book explains how to
                  create programs with the Java programming
                  language. And not just simple, academic programs
                  either--the applets and applications that Ivor
                  Horton describes in later chapters take advantage of
                  the latest features of Java 2. After a brief
                  introduction to the characteristics of Java,
                  Beginning Java 2 digs into variables, data types,
                  operators, control structures, and basic Java
                  syntax--the stuff you absolutely have to understand
                  in order to get anything done. Horton then explains
                  streams, files, and threads before getting into the
                  graphical stuff, where he details how to build
                  attractive, functional user interfaces with the
                  Swing components (with solid coverage of the Java 2
                  event model). Later chapters address Java2D graphics
                  and database connectivity. The author treats object
                  orientation as integral to the rest of Java
                  programming, which is appropriate to the
                  language. Readers get to see how concepts work, as
                  regular Try It Out sections include illustrative
                  code listings and the resulting output. The author
                  and publisher deserve kudos for printing the
                  complete source code of example programs rather than
                  just key excerpts. These example programs also
                  appear on the publisher's Web site. --David Wall},

                  but genuine patriotism for their country binds them
                  together. Pushed beyond their imagined limits, they

                  women: adventure, physical challenge, and personal
                  growth. As ordinary citizens fighting for their
                  country the best way they can, they transform
                  themselves into women of honor, courage, and
                  stature, proving themselves more noble than the

                  originally mentioned in the Hitch Hikers Guide to
                  the Galaxy (or one of its early sequels) as a
                  warning about the nature of improbability.  The
                  story goes that the ship is protected by an
                  improbability field which means that it is almost
                  impossible for anything to go wrong. Upon the ships
                  launch it undergoes a total existence failure and
                  disappears from view.  This book picks up events
                  after this fact.  The book is written by Terry
                  Jones, but based on the ideas of Douglas Adams. The
                  problem was that at the time that the book needed to
                  be written Douglas Adams was far too involved in
                  setting up a software company which I think he
                  probably saw as a way of bringing some of his
                  wildest dreams to fruition. Terry Jones took over
                  writing duty and this book is the result.  In many
                  ways its really a book for the completist Adams fan,
                  but it isn't a bad book, just a bit superfluous.}

                  that government essentially got out of the way and
                  let the free market do *everything*. Friedman's
                  doctrine, wherever it was implemented lead to
                  unemployment, hunger and a general worsening of all
                  sorts of economic indicators (differential between
                  rich and poor, level of crime, unemployment
                  etc). Friedman always maintained that wherever the
                  system wasn't working it was because the free market
                  wasn't free enough.  This book tells the story of
                  the implementing of this economic theory around the
                  world, with one important add on. In any advanced
                  society no government was going to be able to get
                  elected on a purely Friedmanite ticket, so in many
                  cases the introduction was done either by stealth
                  (Poland), or more often by violent insurrection
                  (Chile, Argentina etc).  The thesis of this book is
                  that now the free-market economists are roving the
                  world looking for disasters to exploit, introducing
                  their dreadful policies while people are still
                  picking up the pieces.  A brilliant, though
                  infuriating book.}

                  psychology, neuroscience, sociology, and applied

                  authoritative and engaging guide to the Microsoft
                  Active Directory (AD) for any administrator or
                  developer making the move to the new Windows and
                  this powerful directory standard. Articulate and
                  technically astute, the author comes across as a
                  trusted advisor, providing an expert's view of
                  designing the layout of your company's Active
                  Directory schema. In realistic terms, he shows you
                  how AD can coexist with Unix directories. The book
                  not only provides a collection of screen shots
                  (though there are hands-on tutorials for specific
                  tasks) but also a nicely in-depth tour of what
                  Internet directories are and what advantages Active
                  Directory offers. Case studies on sample domains and
                  organization units (OUs) for sample companies,
                  including a model global corporation, will help you
                  cope with the design of even the most complex
                  directories. Hints for limiting "domains" and
                  favoring the more flexible "organizational units"
                  (OUs) will also help you think in Windows 2000
                  terms. Later sections of the book delve into Active
                  Directory Services Interface (ASDI) scripting using
                  Windows Script Host (WSH), Visual Basic, and even
                  ASPs for browser-based administration. The tips and
                  sample scripts for a variety of common
                  administrative tasks, such as adding new users,
                  changing passwords, and the like, assume very little
                  programming background. This focus on the practical
                  side of administration rounds out an extremely
                  useful and technically savvy guide to Windows 2000
                  that can definitely simplify the life of any
                  administrator, manager, or developer upgrading to
                  the latest Windows. --Richard Dragan},

                  world at home one quiet Saturday afternoon, Ewan
                  McGregor - actor and self-confessed bike nut -
                  noticed that it was possible to ride all the way
                  round the world, with just one short hop across the
                  Bering Strait from Russia to Alaska. It was a
                  revelation he couldn't get out of his head. So he
                  picked up the phone and called Charley Boorman, his
                  best friend, fellow actor and bike
                  enthusiast. 'Charley,' he said. 'I think you ought
                  to come over for dinner...'From London to New York,
                  Ewan and Charley chased their shadows through
                  Europe, the Ukraine, Kazakhstan, Mongolia and
                  Russia, across the Pacific to Alaska, then down
                  through Canada and America. But as the miles slipped
                  beneath the tyres of their big BMWs, their troubles
                  started. Exhaustion, injury and accidents tested
                  their strength. Treacherous roads, unpredictable
                  weather and turbulent politics challenged their
                  stamina. They were chased by paparazzi in
                  Kazakhstan, courted by men with very large guns in
                  the Ukraine, hassled by the police, and given bulls'
                  testicles for supper by Mongolian nomads. And yet
                  despite all these obstacles they managed to ride
                  over 20,000 miles in four months, changing their
                  lives forever in the process. As they travelled they
                  documented their trip, taking photographs, and
                  writing diaries by the campfire. Long Way Round is
                  the result of their adventures - a fascinating,
                  frank and highly entertaining travel book about two
                  friends riding round the world together and, against
                  all the odds, realising their dream.},

                  to use a word processor or text editor and how to
                  deal with files. They teach you that learning HTML

                  you are new to shell programming, Learning the bash
                  Shell is an excellent introduction, covering
                  everything from the most basic to the most advanced
                  features. If you've been writing shell scripts for
                  years, it offers a great way to find out what the
                  bash shell offers. This second edition covers all of
                  the features of bash Version 2.0, while still
                  applying to bash Version 1.x. New features include
                  one-dimensional arrays, parameter expansion, and
                  more pattern-matching operations. In addition, bash
                  2.0 is POSIX.2 conformant. This updated edition
                  covers new commands, security improvements,
                  additions to ReadLine, improved configuration and
                  installation, and an additional programming aid, the
                  bash shell debugger. Whether you want to use bash
                  for its programming features or its user interface,
                  you will find Learning the bash Shell, 2nd Edition a

                  line and in to the past.  He has no control over the

                  apart from the fact that they can only ever take him

                  provide aid to him for these hops. He is a frequent

                  transitioning to C++. Unlike most other C++ books,

                  approach, including how to debug, how to make your
                  code understandable to others, and how to understand
                  other people's code. Topics covered include good
                  programming style, C++ syntax (what to use and what
                  not to use), C++ class design, debugging and

                  of writing fiction. With more than twenty-five years

                  designed to develop and refine two basic skills:
                  writing like a writer and, just as important,
                  thinking like a writer. They deal with such topics
                  as discovering where to start and end a story;
                  learning when to use dialogue and when to use
                  indirect discourse; transforming real events into

                  communicates precisely. What If?  will be an
                  essential addition to every writer's library, a

                  mother tongue? Why do languages change over time,
                  making Shakespearean English difficult for us to
                  follow and Chaucer's English almost
                  incomprehensible? Why do languages have so many
                  quirks and irregularities? Are they all
                  fundamentally alike?  How are new words created?
                  Where in the brain does language reside? In Words
                  and Rules, Steven Pinker answers these and many
                  other questions. His new book shares the wit and
                  style of his classic, The Language Instinct, but
                  explores language in a completely different way. In
                  this book, Pinker explains the profound mysteries of
                  language by picking a deceptively simple single
                  phenomenon and examining it from every angle. That
                  phenomenon ' the existence of regular and
                  irregular verbs ' connects an astonishing
                  array of topics in the sciences and humanities: the
                  history of languages; the attempts to duplicate
                  human language using computer simulations; the
                  illuminating errors of children as they begin to
                  speak; the peculiarities of the English language;
                  the sources of the major themes in the history of
                  Western philosophy; the latest techniques in
                  identifying genes and imaging the living
                  brain. Pinker makes sense of all of this with the
                  help of a single, powerful idea: that language
                  comprises a mental dictionary of memorized words and
                  a mental grammar of creative rules. It is a
                  distinction that extends beyond language and offers
                  insight into the very nature of the human
                  mind. Words and Rules is a sparkling, eye-opening,
                  and utterly original book by one of the world's
                  leading cognitive scientists.},

                  uniquely British sense of the absurd, and
                  side-splitting, smart humor. Jingo is the 20th of
                  Pratchett's Discworld novels, and the fourth to

                  Ankh-Morpork and Al-Khali, capital of Klatch. Both

                  Khufurah, and set fire to their embassy, before war

                  Captain Carrot, who always finds the best in people
                  and puts it to work playing football, to Sergeant

                  pavement." Then there is the mysterious D'reg,
                  71-hour Ahmed. What is his part in all this, and why
                  71 hours? Anyone who doesn't mind laughing

                  completely alone or so he thinks until he finds the
                  ghost girl. She has no toes, wears strange lacy

                  but it seems, for now, that all she has for company

                  book in April 2009, a little over six months since
                  the banking system almost went in to meltdown, and,
                  weirdly for a Terry Pratchett book, this actually
                  felt almost topical! Not that the world of
                  Discworld's banks need bailing out to the tune of
                  billions of dollars, but being about banking, and
                  trying to make it something that could benefit
                  everyone, not just the already obscenely rich. The
                  story is a sequel to 'Going Postal', an earlier
                  entry in the Discworld canon. This time the central
                  character 'Moist Von Lipwig' has been asked to take
                  over the running of the Royal Bank of Ankh-Morpork.
                  The reason is that Vetinari, the tyrannical ruler is
                  intent on expanding the city and he needs a banking
                  system that makes that possible. I'm strongly of the
                  opinion that Terry Pratchett's writing has almost
                  continuously improved as the Discworld series has
                  gone on. His ideas, plotting and execution have
                  improved during the time he has been regailing us
                  with his tales. 'Making Money' does nothing to buck
                  that trend in my mind. It is an enjoyable romp full
                  of deft, humourous touches. If you're a fan then I
                  think you'll love it. If you're not and you sneer at
                  fantasy, then this won't be enough to convert you.}

                  bang in The Ruby in the Smoke--a fast-paced, finely
                  crafted thriller set in a rogue- and scalawag-ridden
                  Victorian London. His 16-year-old heroine has no
                  time for the usual trials of adolescence: her father
                  has been murdered, and she needs to find out how and
                  why. But everywhere she turns, she encounters new
                  scoundrels and secrets. Why do the mere words "seven
                  blessings" cause one man to keel over and die at
                  their utterance? Who has possession of the rare,
                  stolen ruby? And what does the opium trade have to
                  do with it? As our determined and intelligent sleuth
                  sets her mind to unraveling these dark mysteries,
                  she learns how embroiled she is in the whole
                  affair. As riveting and witty as the sensational

                  trilogy (including The Shadow in the North and The

	annote = {Information about this book:

* I attended a midnight opening of Heffers in Cambridge for the launch
  of this book.  Two local authors read from the opening of the book,
  which must have been difficult for them given that they hadn't been
  allowed to read it beforehand.

* This is the first book of a new trilogy which Pullman is being very
  careful to label not as a prequel or sequel, but as an equel to the
  'Northern Lights' trilogy.  The story concerns Lyra, but she is a
  baby, quite unable to look after herself.

Review and Thoughts having finished the book:

When I have been talking to people about this book, I have had to make
an important point, because of the book series that the 'Northern
Lights' was always 'up against'.

I love JK Rowling and her books. I have loved reading all 7 of the
Harry Potter books to my daughter, and relishing the pleasure I had in
reading them the first time round.

But, my goodness, Philip Pullman writes circles around JK! She is full
of great ideas for a story, and her execution has always got better,
but Philip Pullman writes with so much clarity and energy that you do
feel yourself much more involved both physically and emotionally in
the protaganist's world.

The best example of this, by way of demonstration, is when you
consider the subject of daemons.  The idea is magical, but it is quite
alien to readers in this world. But we now have such sympathy and such
experience of the idea that when Malcolm has to pull himself away from
his daemon it is a traumatic thing to read about.  It is, truly gut
wrenching.

At this point in time I'm reading 'Northern Lights' with Lizzie, and
she is also falling for this wonderful world.  But 'La Belle Sauvage'
isn't just a worthy entry in the canon, it is a powerful buttressing
column of the canon, holding up this wonderful existence in the
reader's mind.

Brilliant.

The only bad thing is that there is likely to be a long wait for the
next one!},

                  widowed father -- an affectionate rogue, dissolute
                  and promiscuous. Having accepted the constantly

                  the French Revolution is often drawn very much as an
                  overall failure. The revolution itself being
                  followed by 'The Terror', an unstable period with
                  the revolutionaries turning on each other, resulting
                  in an orgy of deaths. But this book redresses the
                  balance somewhat, showing that while 'The Terror'
                  was real the advances in French society were real
                  too.  It is in many ways a reclaiming of what was

                  programmes for Channel 4 which combined politics
                  with humour by staging stunts which hightlighted the
                  idiocy of his subjects. Nowadays he doesn't have a
                  regular series on Channel 4, but he does
                  occassionally make programmes (the latest was about

                  attends and participates in large numbers of

                  another of his occassional programmes, this time
                  about the idiocy of the arms trade. The story he
                  tells is shocking, but exposes to ridicule a strange
                  section of industry, those who make their money from
                  selling the instruments of torture and death.  A
                  brilliant page turner even if it makes you want to

                  admission that Mark is a former Coke fan, but that
                  as he has learnt more about the company, how it
                  operates and how it treats its workers world wide he
                  has foresworn any further involvement with them. The
                  story isn't as obviously clear cut at that of the
                  arms trade, but it does address many of the issues
                  of globalisation. Specifically, just how much
                  responsibility does the parent company have for the
                  way people who are carrying out their business are
                  treated.  The Coke business model relies heavily on
                  the fact that the company just sells syrups to
                  bottling plants around the world who are then free
                  to run their business as they please.  And many of
                  them are viciously anti-union and anti-workers
                  rights. Coke themselves distance themselves from
                  these behaviours, but if you care about these things
                  then this book is likely to lead you to hold your
                  own personal boycott of the company.  I know its had

                  Grand Master Award for lifetime achievement. In The
                  Chimney Sweeper's Boy, Vine proves herself the equal
                  of her alter ego and a master of the psychological
                  thriller--as well as the police procedural--in this
                  riveting novel. Why bestselling novelist Gerald
                  Candless assumed a new identity years before his
                  marriage and the birth of his two daughters isn't
                  revealed until the penultimate chapter of the book,
                  but the effect of his deception on his family drives
                  Vine's deft character studies. In Gerald's wife,
                  Ursula, and his daughters, Hope and Sarah, Vine has
                  created three complex women in the thrall of an
                  equally complicated and compelling man. As Sarah
                  unravels the mystery of her father's deception,
                  Gerald gradually becomes a more sympathetic
                  figure. But Ursula, whose strange marital bargain
                  with Gerald and whose distant relationship with her
                  daughters tug at the heart, stays with the reader
                  long after this distinguished, literary mystery is

                  novel (or so he says), as a victory lap. It's a
                  confident final trot 'round the track by one of the
                  greats of postwar American literature. After 40
                  years of practice, Vonnegut's got his schtick down
                  cold, and it's a pleasure--if a slightly tame
                  one--to watch him go through his paces one more
                  time. Timequake's a mongrel; it is half novel, half
                  memoir, the project of a decade's worth of writer's
                  block, a book "that didn't want to be written." The
                  premise is standard-issue Vonnegut: "...a timequake,
                  a sudden glitch in the space-time continuum, made
                  everybody and everything do exactly what they'd done
                  during past decades, for good or ill, a second
                  time..." Simultaneously, the author's favorite
                  tricks are on display--frequent visits with the
                  shopworn science fiction writer Kilgore Trout, a
                  Hitchcockian appearance by the author at the book's
                  end, and frequent authorial opining on love, war,

                  millions who read the award-winning strip. One look
                  at the new Calvin and Hobbes collection and it is

                  imagination, wit, and sense of adventure continue to

                  cartoons never before published in book form, Calvin
                  and his tiger-striped sidekick Hobbes are hilarious
                  whether the two are simply lounging around
                  philosophizing about the future of mankind or
                  plotting their latest money-making
                  scheme. Chock-full of the familiar adventures of

                  popularity poll, and time travel to the Jurrassic

                  side of Scottishness. The main character, Mark
                  Renton, is at the center of a clique of nihilistic
                  slacker junkies with no hopes and no possibilities,

                  nothing left but the blackest of humor and a
                  sharpness of wit. American readers can use the
                  glossary in the back to translate the slang and
                  dialect--essential, since the dialogue makes the
                  book. This is a bleak vision sung as musical

                  book.  The language that the book is written in
                  means that as a non-native you have to pass through
                  a similar process to the one that takes place when
                  reading Antony Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange' for the
                  first time.  That is you have to let the language
                  wash over you to an extent.  The book wouldn't feel
                  right in received pronounciation, especially the
                  Begby character, a psychopath who will glass people
                  for kicks.  Strangely Morag, who it seems to me
                  should have found the language easier to deal with
                  than me never got on with the book and abandoned it
                  midway.  It is worth noting that having read this
