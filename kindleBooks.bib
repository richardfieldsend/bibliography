@Book{pullman17:_la_belle_sauvag,
	annote = {Information about this book:

* I attended a midnight opening of Heffers in Cambridge for the launch
  of this book.  Two local authors read from the opening of the book,
  which must have been difficult for them given that they hadn't been
  allowed to read it beforehand.

* This is the first book of a new trilogy which Pullman is being very
  careful to label not as a prequel or sequel, but as an equel to the
  'Northern Lights' trilogy.  The story concerns Lyra, but she is a
  baby, quite unable to look after herself.

Review and Thoughts having finished the book:

When I have been talking to people about this book, I have had to make
an important point, because of the book series that the 'Northern
Lights' was always 'up against'.

I love JK Rowling and her books. I have loved reading all 7 of the
Harry Potter books to my daughter, and relishing the pleasure I had in
reading them the first time round.

But, my goodness, Philip Pullman writes circles around JK! She is full
of great ideas for a story, and her execution has always got better,
but Philip Pullman writes with so much clarity and energy that you do
feel yourself much more involved both physically and emotionally in
the protaganist's world.

The best example of this, by way of demonstration, is when you
consider the subject of daemons.  The idea is magical, but it is quite
alien to readers in this world. But we now have such sympathy and such
experience of the idea that when Malcolm has to pull himself away from
his daemon it is a traumatic thing to read about.  It is, truly gut
wrenching.

At this point in time I'm reading 'Northern Lights' with Lizzie, and
she is also falling for this wonderful world.  But 'La Belle Sauvage'
isn't just a worthy entry in the canon, it is a powerful buttressing
column of the canon, holding up this wonderful existence in the
reader's mind.

Brilliant.

The only bad thing is that there is likely to be a long wait for the
next one!},
